# Galvanize Student Admissions Hub

Galvanize is a company that conducts coding immersive courses and must determine if potential students possess the aptitude required to make it through the curriculum by conducting a live coding interview. This is a Full-Stack Application using the NextJS framework to unite Front and Back-End codebases. Features of this application is to create a hub that interviewers can log into to add/delete/update student data and conduct live coding interviews with them using socket.io. Stats regarding interview pass rate and other items are collected and displayed to the current interviewer account that is logged in.

## Learn More - Next.js

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.
- [Free Tutorial Project for Next.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFuwkrseXVE) - basic project tutorial to get you familiar with Next.js
- [The Ultimate NEXT.JS 13 Tutorial (Complete Walkthrough w/ Examples)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aP9nyTcd44&t=292s) - by Sonny Sangha

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Features

- Enabled secure authentication/authorization for user account login
- Created profile page with info about each user and ability to modify account settings
- Major reorganization of code architecture and implemented industry standard practices for extensible, readible code reducing the overall techincal debt of the project
- Fixed dozens of bugs that caused application to crash, expedited and streamlined data transfer between the database and back-end, cleaned up various CSS styling issues, and updated the ui elements related to statistical tracking to reflect current and any future events
- Implemented Pupeteer test suite to automate testing of the application

#### MailHog 
##### Overview
MailHog is an email testing tool for developers:
* Configure your application to use MailHog for SMTP delivery
* View messages in the web UI, or retrieve them with the JSON API
* Optionally release messages to real SMTP servers for delivery

##### Installation
MacOS

    $   brew update && brew install mailhog

Then, start MailHog by running

in the command line.

##### Nodemailer
- is a module for Node.js applications to allow easy  email sending.

##### Getting Started 
1. Install mailhog
2. Run mailhog by typing $ mailhog in CLI
3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:8025/ , you should see Web UI 

![Mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog/raw/master/docs/MailHog.png)

4. Run express server by going to express directory and running node Express.mjs  in CLI
5. Go to login page
6. Click on Forgot button

## Puppeteer
Puppeteer is a Node.js library that provides a high-level API for controlling headless Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol.

It allows you to automate tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming and repetitive, such as:

- Generating screenshots and PDFs of pages

- Crawlin websites to extract data

- Automating form submissions and UI testing

We have incorporated several tests utilizing Puppeteer see the wiki for more information: https://github.com/gschool-blue-ocean/admissions-hub/wiki


## To-Do / Future Features
- we wanted to finish the testing of every feature to make sure the application doesnt't contain any bugs. 
- as well as incorporationg jest with puppeteer.
- Add the email csv functionality to the csv file for exporting student info
- Refactor the code for forgot password on the login page. Note* CURRENTLY IT WORKS BUT ONLY SENDS THE EMAIL TO MAILHOG. 
- Link to third party services under account update

 ## Advice for the future group

When we took over this project we almost deconstructed the file format. Our knee jerk reaction was to reformat the file structure based on how wierd it looked. Note: This file structure in ADMISSIONS HUB is formatted to work specifically with NEXT.JS framework. Please do your research on how NEXT.JS works before considering any refactoring of the code base.
